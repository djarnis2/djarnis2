# Hi, I'm Lars 👋

Software engineering student (SDU) strong in **math/algorithms** and **backend/web**.  
Mostly working with **Java** and **Python**. I build small projects to sharpen **JS, APIs, Docker (familiarity), and web scraping**,  
and I occasionally do CTFs with **Brunerne**.

## I like building
- Small, clear **backend services** and API clients
- Robust **scrapers** (pagination, state, retry)
- Simple **web UIs** that are easy to use and test

## Toolbox
Java · Python · JavaScript · React · REST/JSON · SQL/MySQL · Selenium · NumPy · Linux · Git/GitHub · Docker 

## Featured projects
- **[apod-project](https://github.com/djarnis2/apod-project)** (Node/Express): 
  Import NASA APODs by **date range** and **search** across imported entries. Falls back to the standard image when **HD** is unavailable.

- **[movies](https://github.com/djarnis2/movies)** (TMDB scraper + React): 
  Selenium/BS4 with pagination, **search/filter** and links to TMDB details. Built as a clean, lightweight React UI.

- **[BlazeBalls](https://github.com/djarnis2/BlazeBalls)** (JavaFX + JPMS):  
  Modular architecture, **delta-time** movement, centralized bullet logic. Simpler codebase → better testability.

- **[dl25e](https://github.com/djarnis2/dl25e)** (FullyConnectedNN in NumPy):  
  From scratch: forward/backprop, ReLU/Softmax, cross-entropy; trained and evaluated on BloodMNIST.

## Now
- Polishing this README and updating old projects.
- Open to a **software internship (backend/web)** - feel free to reach out!
